# Monitoring the Status of Your Instances<a name="monitoring-instances-status-check"></a>

You can monitor the status of your instances by viewing status checks and scheduled events for your instances\. A status check gives you the information that results from automated checks performed by Amazon EC2\. These automated checks detect whether specific issues are affecting your instances\. The status check information, together with the data provided by Amazon CloudWatch, gives you detailed operational visibility into each of your instances\. 

You can also see status on specific events scheduled for your instances\. Events provide information about upcoming activities such as rebooting or retirement that are planned for your instances, along with the scheduled start and end time of each event\.
