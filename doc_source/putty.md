# Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY<a name="putty"></a>

After you launch your instance, you can connect to it and use it the way that you'd use a computer sitting in front of you\.

**Note**  
After you launch an instance, it can take a few minutes for the instance to be ready so that you can connect to it\. Check that your instance has passed its status checks\. You can view this information in the **Status Checks** column on the **Instances** page\.

The following instructions explain how to connect to your instance using PuTTY, a free SSH client for Windows\. If you receive an error while attempting to connect to your instance, see [Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="putty-prereqs"></a>

Before you connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY, complete the following prerequisites:
+ **Install PuTTY**

  Download and install PuTTY from the [PuTTY download page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)\. If you already have an older version of PuTTY installed, we recommend that you download the latest version\. Be sure to install the entire suite\.
+ **Get the ID of the instance**

  You can get the ID of your instance using the Amazon EC2 console \(from the **Instance ID** column\)\. If you prefer, you can use the [describe\-instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) \(AWS CLI\) or [Get\-EC2Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\) command\.
+ **Get the public DNS name of the instance**

  You can get the public DNS for your instance using the Amazon EC2 console \(check the **Public DNS \(IPv4\)** column; if this column is hidden, choose the **Show/Hide** icon and select **Public DNS \(IPv4\)**\)\. If you prefer, you can use the [describe\-instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) \(AWS CLI\) or [Get\-EC2Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\) command\.
+ **\(IPv6 only\) Get the IPv6 address of the instance**

  If you've assigned an IPv6 address to your instance, you can optionally connect to the instance using its IPv6 address instead of a public IPv4 address or public IPv4 DNS hostname\. Your local computer must have an IPv6 address and must be configured to use IPv6\. You can get the IPv6 address of your instance using the Amazon EC2 console \(check the **IPv6 IPs** field\)\. If you prefer, you can use the [describe\-instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) \(AWS CLI\) or [Get\-EC2Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\) command\. For more information about IPv6, see [IPv6 Addresses](using-instance-addressing.md#ipv6-addressing)\.
+ **Locate the private key**

  Get the fully qualified path to the location on your computer of the `.pem` file for the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance\.
+ **Get the default user name for the AMI that you used to launch your instance**
  + For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is `ec2-user`\.
  + For a Centos AMI, the user name is `centos`\.
  + For a Debian AMI, the user name is `admin` or `root`\.
  + For a Fedora AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `fedora`\.
  + For a RHEL AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
  + For a SUSE AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
  + For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is `ubuntu` or `root`\.
  + Otherwise, if `ec2-user` and `root` don't work, check with the AMI provider\.
+ **Enable inbound SSH traffic from your IP address to your instance**

  Ensure that the security group associated with your instance allows incoming SSH traffic from your IP address\. The default security group does not allow incoming SSH traffic by default\. For more information, see [Authorizing Inbound Traffic for Your Linux Instances](authorizing-access-to-an-instance.md)\.

## Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen<a name="putty-private-key"></a>

PuTTY does not natively support the private key format \(\.pem\) generated by Amazon EC2\. PuTTY has a tool named PuTTYgen, which can convert keys to the required PuTTY format \(\.ppk\)\. You must convert your private key into this format \(\.ppk\) before attempting to connect to your instance using PuTTY\.

**To convert your private key**

1. Start PuTTYgen \(for example, from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTYgen**\)\.

1. Under **Type of key to generate**, choose **RSA**\.  
![\[RSA key in PuTTYgen\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/puttygen-key-type.png)

   If you're using an older version of PuTTYgen, choose **SSH\-2 RSA**\.

1. Choose **Load**\. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the extension `.ppk`\. To locate your `.pem` file, select the option to display files of all types\.  
![\[Select all file types\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/puttygen-load-key.png)

1. Select your `.pem` file for the key pair that you specified when you launched your instance, and then choose **Open**\. Choose **OK** to dismiss the confirmation dialog box\.

1. Choose **Save private key** to save the key in the format that PuTTY can use\. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase\. Choose **Yes**\.
**Note**  
A passphrase on a private key is an extra layer of protection, so even if your private key is discovered, it can't be used without the passphrase\. The downside to using a passphrase is that it makes automation harder because human intervention is needed to log on to an instance, or copy files to an instance\.

1. Specify the same name for the key that you used for the key pair \(for example, `my-key-pair`\)\. PuTTY automatically adds the `.ppk` file extension\. 

Your private key is now in the correct format for use with PuTTY\. You can now connect to your instance using PuTTY's SSH client\.

## Starting a PuTTY Session<a name="putty-ssh"></a>

Use the following procedure to connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY\. You need the `.ppk` file that you created for your private key\. If you receive an error while attempting to connect to your instance, see [Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html)\.

**To start a PuTTY session**

1. \(Optional\) You can verify the RSA key fingerprint on your instance using the [get\-console\-output](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-console-output.html) \(AWS CLI\) command on your local system \(not on the instance\)\. This is useful if you've launched your instance from a public AMI from a third party\. Locate the `SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS` section, and note the RSA fingerprint \(for example, 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f\) and compare it to the fingerprint of the instance\.

   ```
   aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id instance_id
   ```

   Here is an example of what you should look for:

   ```
   -----BEGIN SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS-----
   ... 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f ...
   -----END SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS-----
   ```

   The `SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS` section is only available after the first boot of the instance\.

1. Start PuTTY \(from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**\)\.

1. In the **Category** pane, choose **Session** and complete the following fields:

   1. In the **Host Name** box, enter *user\_name*@*public\_dns\_name*\. Be sure to specify the appropriate user name for your AMI\. For example:
      + For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is `ec2-user`\.
      + For a Centos AMI, the user name is `centos`\.
      + For a Debian AMI, the user name is `admin` or `root`\.
      + For a Fedora AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `fedora`\.
      + For a RHEL AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
      + For a SUSE AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
      + For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is `ubuntu` or `root`\.
      + Otherwise, if `ec2-user` and `root` don't work, check with the AMI provider\.

   1. \(IPv6 only\) To connect using your instance's IPv6 address, enter *user\_name*@*ipv6\_address*\. Be sure to specify the appropriate user name for your AMI\. For example:
      + For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is `ec2-user`\.
      + For a Centos AMI, the user name is `centos`\.
      + For a Debian AMI, the user name is `admin` or `root`\.
      + For a Fedora AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `fedora`\.
      + For a RHEL AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
      + For a SUSE AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
      + For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is `ubuntu` or `root`\.
      + Otherwise, if `ec2-user` and `root` don't work, check with the AMI provider\.

   1. Under **Connection type**, select **SSH**\.

   1. Ensure that **Port** is 22\.  
![\[PuTTY configuration - Session\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/putty-session-config.png)

1. \(Optional\) You can configure PuTTY to automatically send 'keepalive' data at regular intervals to keep the session active\. This is useful to avoid disconnecting from your instance due to session inactivity\. In the **Category** pane, choose **Connection**, and then enter the required interval in the **Seconds between keepalives** field\. For example, if your session disconnects after 10 minutes of inactivity, enter 180 to configure PuTTY to send keepalive data every 3 minutes\.

1. In the **Category** pane, expand **Connection**, expand **SSH**, and then choose **Auth**\. Complete the following: 

   1. Choose **Browse**\.

   1. Select the `.ppk` file that you generated for your key pair, and then choose **Open**\.

   1. \(Optional\) If you plan to start this session again later, you can save the session information for future use\. Choose **Session** in the **Category** tree, enter a name for the session in **Saved Sessions**, and then choose **Save**\.

   1. Choose **Open** to start the PuTTY session\.  
![\[PuTTY configuration - Auth\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/putty-auth-config.png)

1. If this is the first time you have connected to this instance, PuTTY displays a security alert dialog box that asks whether you trust the host you are connecting to\.

1. \(Optional\) Verify that the fingerprint in the security alert dialog box matches the fingerprint that you previously obtained in step 1\. If these fingerprints don't match, someone might be attempting a "man\-in\-the\-middle" attack\. If they match, continue to the next step\.

1. Choose **Yes**\. A window opens and you are connected to your instance\.
**Note**  
If you specified a passphrase when you converted your private key to PuTTY's format, you must provide that passphrase when you log in to the instance\.

If you receive an error while attempting to connect to your instance, see [Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html)\.

## Transferring Files to Your Linux Instance Using the PuTTY Secure Copy Client<a name="putty-scp"></a>

The PuTTY Secure Copy client \(PSCP\) is a command\-line tool that you can use to transfer files between your Windows computer and your Linux instance\. If you prefer a graphical user interface \(GUI\), you can use an open source GUI tool named WinSCP\. For more information, see [Transferring Files to Your Linux Instance Using WinSCP](#Transfer_WinSCP)\.

To use PSCP, you need the private key you generated in [Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen](#putty-private-key)\. You also need the public DNS address of your Linux instance\. 

The following example transfers the file `Sample_file.txt` from the C:\\ drive on a Windows computer to the `ec2-user` home directory on an Amazon Linux instance:

```
pscp -i C:\path\my-key-pair.ppk C:\path\Sample_file.txt ec2-user@public_dns:/home/ec2-user/Sample_file.txt
```

\(IPv6 only\) The following example transfers the file `Sample_file.txt` using the instance's IPv6 address\. The IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets \(\[\]\)\.

```
pscp -i C:\path\my-key-pair.ppk C:\path\Sample_file.txt ec2-user@[ipv6-address]:/home/ec2-user/Sample_file.txt
```

## Transferring Files to Your Linux Instance Using WinSCP<a name="Transfer_WinSCP"></a>

WinSCP is a GUI\-based file manager for Windows that allows you to upload and transfer files to a remote computer using the SFTP, SCP, FTP, and FTPS protocols\. WinSCP allows you to drag and drop files from your Windows machine to your Linux instance or synchronize entire directory structures between the two systems\.

 To use WinSCP, you need the private key you generated in [Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen](#putty-private-key)\. You also need the public DNS address of your Linux instance\.

1. Download and install WinSCP from [http://winscp\.net/eng/download\.php](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)\. For most users, the default installation options are OK\.

1. Start WinSCP\.

1. At the **WinSCP login** screen, for **Host name**, enter the public DNS hostname or public IPv4 address for your instance\.

   \(IPv6 only\) To log in using your instance's IPv6 address, enter the IPv6 address for your instance\.

1. For **User name**, enter the default user name for your AMI\.
   + For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is `ec2-user`\.
   + For a Centos AMI, the user name is `centos`\.
   + For a Debian AMI, the user name is `admin` or `root`\.
   + For a Fedora AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `fedora`\.
   + For a RHEL AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
   + For a SUSE AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`\.
   + For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is `ubuntu` or `root`\.
   + Otherwise, if `ec2-user` and `root` don't work, check with the AMI provider\.

1. Specify the private key for your instance\. For **Private key**, enter the path to your private key, or choose the "**\.\.\.**" button to browse for the file\. For newer versions of WinSCP, choose **Advanced** to open the advanced site settings and then under **SSH**, choose **Authentication** to find the **Private key file** setting\.

   Here is a screenshot from WinSCP version 5\.9\.4:  
![\[WinSCP Advanced screen\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/WinSCP-keypair.png)

   WinSCP requires a PuTTY private key file \(`.ppk`\)\. You can convert a `.pem` security key file to the `.ppk` format using PuTTYgen\. For more information, see [Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen](#putty-private-key)\.

1. \(Optional\) In the left panel, choose **Directories**, and then, for **Remote directory**, enter the path for the directory you want to add files to\. For newer versions of WinSCP, choose **Advanced** to open the advanced site settings and then under **Environment**, choose **Directories** to find the **Remote directory** setting\.

1. Choose **Login** to connect, and choose **Yes** to add the host fingerprint to the host cache\.  
![\[WinSCP screen\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/WinSCP-connection.png)

1. After the connection is established, in the connection window your Linux instance is on the right and your local machine is on the left\. You can drag and drop files directly into the remote file system from your local machine\. For more information on WinSCP, see the project documentation at [http://winscp\.net/eng/docs/start](http://winscp.net/eng/docs/start)\.

   If you receive a "Cannot execute SCP to start transfer" error, you must first install scp on your Linux instance\. For some operating systems, this is located in the `openssh-clients` package\. For Amazon Linux variants, such as the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI, use the following command to install scp\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install -y openssh-clients
   ```
