If you're new to Amazon EC2, see the following topics to get started:

Before you launch a production environment, you need to answer the following questions\.

**Q\. What instance type best meets my needs?**  
Amazon EC2 provides different instance types to enable you to choose the CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity that you need to run your applications\. For more information, see [Instance Types](instance-types.md)\.

**Q\. What purchasing option best meets my needs?**  
Amazon EC2 supports On\-Demand instances \(the default\), Spot instances, and Reserved Instances\. For more information, see [Instance Purchasing Options](instance-purchasing-options.md)\.

**Q\. Which type of root volume meets my needs?**  
Each instance is backed by Amazon EBS or backed by instance store\. Select an AMI based on which type of root volume you need\. For more information, see [Storage for the Root Device](ComponentsAMIs.md#storage-for-the-root-device)\.

**Q\. Would I benefit from using a virtual private cloud?**  
If you can launch instances in either EC2\-Classic or EC2\-VPC, you'll need to decide which platform meets your needs\. For more information, see [Supported Platforms](ec2-supported-platforms.md) and [Amazon EC2 and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](using-vpc.md)\.

**Q\. Can I remotely manage a fleet of EC2 instances *and* machines in my hybrid environment?**  
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) Run Command lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your Amazon EC2 instances, virtual machines \(VMs\) and servers in hybrid environments, or VMs from other cloud providers\. For more information, see [Systems Manager Remote Management \(Run Command\)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/execute-remote-commands.html)\.
