# Working with Dedicated Hosts<a name="how-dedicated-hosts-work"></a>

To use a Dedicated Host, you first allocate hosts for use in your account\. You then launch instances onto the hosts by specifying *host* tenancy for the instance\. You must select a specific host for the instance to launch on to, or you can allow it to launch on to any host that has auto\-placement enabled and matches its instance type\. When an instance is stopped and restarted, the *Host affinity* setting determines whether it's restarted on the same, or a different, host\.

If you no longer need an On\-Demand host, you can stop the instances running on the host, direct them to launch on a different host, and then *release* the host\.

## Understanding Auto\-Placement and Affinity<a name="dedicated-hosts-understanding"></a>

Placement control happens on both the instance level and host level\.

### Auto\-Placement<a name="dedicated-hosts-auto-placement"></a>

Auto\-placement allows you to manage whether instances that you launch are launched onto a specific host, or onto any available host that has matching configurations\. Auto\-placement must be configured at the host level\.

When a Dedicated Host's auto\-placement is *disabled*, it only accepts *Host* tenancy instance launches that specify its unique host ID\. This is the default setting for new Dedicated Hosts\.

When a Dedicated Host's auto\-placement is *enabled*, it accepts any untargeted instance launches that match its instance type configuration\.

When launching an instance, you need to configure its tenancy\. Launching an instance onto a Dedicated Host without providing a specific `HostId`, enables it to launch on any Dedicated Host that has auto\-placement *enabled* and matches its instance type\.

### Host Affinity<a name="dedicated-hosts-affinity"></a>

Host Affinity is configured at the instance level\. It establishes a launch relationship between an instance and a Dedicated Host\.

When affinity is set to `Host`, an instance launched onto a specific host always restarts on the same host if stopped\. This applies to both targeted and untargeted launches\.

When affinity is set to `Off`, and you stop and restart the instance, it can be restarted on any available host\. However, it tries to launch back onto the last Dedicated Host on which it ran \(on a best\-effort basis\)\.

## Allocating Dedicated Hosts<a name="dedicated-hosts-allocating"></a>

To begin using Dedicated Hosts, they need to be allocated to your account\. You can allocate Dedicated Hosts to your account using the Amazon EC2 console or the command line tools\.

**To allocate Dedicated Hosts using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**, and then choose **Allocate Dedicated Host**\.

1. Configure the following Dedicated Host options:

   1. **Instance type**—The type of instance you want to launch on the Dedicated Host\.

   1. **Availability Zone**—The Availability Zone in which the Dedicated Host is located\.

   1. **Allow instance auto\-placement**—Choose one of the following settings:
      + Yes—The Dedicated Host accepts untargeted instance launches that match its instance type configuration\.
      + No—The Dedicated Host accepts `host` tenancy instances launches that specify its unique host ID only\. This is the default setting\.

      For more information about auto\-placement, see [Understanding Auto\-Placement and Affinity](#dedicated-hosts-understanding)\.

   1. **Quantity**—The number of Dedicated Hosts to allocate with these options\.

1. Choose **Allocate host**\.

**To allocate Dedicated Hosts using the command line tools**

Use one of the following commands\. The following examples allocate a Dedicated Host that supports *untargeted* `m4.large` instance launches in the `eu-west-1a` Availability Zone\.
+ [allocate\-hosts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ec2 allocate-hosts --instance-type "m4.large" --availability-zone "eu-west-1a" --auto-placement "off" --quantity 1
  ```
+ [New\-EC2Host](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Host.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

  ```
  PS C:\> New-EC2Host -InstanceType m4.large -AvailabilityZone eu-west-1a -AutoPlacement Off -Quantity 1
  ```

The Dedicated Host capacity is made available in your account immediately\.

If you launch instances with `host` tenancy but do not have any active Dedicated Host in your account, you receive an error and the instance launch fails\.

## Launching Instances onto Dedicated Hosts<a name="launching-dedicated-hosts-instances"></a>

After you have allocated a Dedicated Host, you can launch instances onto it\. You cannot launch instances with `host` tenancy if you do not have active Dedicated Hosts with enough available capacity for the instance type you are launching\.

**Note**  
The instances launched onto Dedicated Hosts can only be launched in a VPC\. For more information, see [Introduction to VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html)\.

Before you launch your instances, take note of the limitations\. For more information, see [Dedicated Hosts Limitations and Restrictions](dedicated-hosts-overview.md#dedicated-hosts-limitations)\.

  ```
+ [Get\-EC2Host](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Host.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

  ```
  PS C:\> Get-EC2Host -HostId host_id
  ```

## Monitoring Dedicated Hosts<a name="dedicated-hosts-monitoring"></a>

Amazon EC2 constantly monitors the state of your Dedicated Hosts; updates are communicated on the Amazon EC2 console\. You can also obtain information about your Dedicated Hosts using the command line tools\.

**To view the state of a Dedicated Host using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**\.

1. Locate the Dedicated Host in the list and review the value in the **State** column\.

**To view the state of a Dedicated Host using the command line tools**

Use one of the following commands and then review the `state` property in the `hostSet` response element:
+ [describe\-hosts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-hosts.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ec2 describe-hosts --host-id host_id
  ```
+ [Get\-EC2Host](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Host.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

  ```
  PS C:\> Get-EC2Host -HostId host_id
  ```

The following table explains the possible Dedicated Host states\.


| **State** | **Description** | 
| --- | --- | 
| available | AWS hasn't detected an issue with the Dedicated Host; no maintenance or repairs are scheduled\. Instances can be launched onto this Dedicated Host\. | 
| released | The Dedicated Host has been released\. The host ID is no longer in use\. Released hosts cannot be reused\. | 
| under\-assessment | AWS is exploring a possible issue with the Dedicated Host\. If action needs to be taken, you are notified via the AWS Management Console or email\. Instances cannot be launched onto a Dedicated Host in this state\. | 
| permanent\-failure | An unrecoverable failure has been detected\. You receive an eviction notice through your instances and by email\. Your instances may continue to run\. If you stop or terminate all instances on a Dedicated Host with this state, AWS retires the host\. Instances cannot be launched onto Dedicated Hosts in this state\. | 
| released\-permanent\-failure | AWS permanently releases Dedicated Hosts that have failed and no longer have running instances on them\. The Dedicated Host ID is no longer available for use\. | 

## Releasing Dedicated Hosts<a name="dedicated-hosts-releasing"></a>

Any running instances on the Dedicated Host need to be stopped before you can release the host\. These instances can be migrated to other Dedicated Hosts in your account so that you can continue to use them\. These steps apply only to On\-Demand Dedicated Hosts\.

**To release a Dedicated Host using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Choose **Dedicated Hosts** in the navigation pane\.

1. On the **Dedicated Hosts** page, select the Dedicated Host to release\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Release Hosts**\.

1. Choose **Release** to confirm\.

**To release a Dedicated Host using the command line tools**

Use one of the following commands:
+ [release\-hosts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/release-hosts.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ec2 release-hosts --host-ids host_id
  ```
+ [Remove\-EC2Hosts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Host.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

  ```
  PS C:\> Remove-EC2Hosts -HostId host_id
  ```

After you release a Dedicated Host, you cannot reuse the same host or host ID again, and you are no longer charged On\-Demand billing rates for it\. The Dedicated Host's state is changed to `released` and you are not able to launch any instances onto that host\.

**Note**  
If you've recently released Dedicated Hosts, it may take some time for them to stop counting towards your limit\. During this time, you may experience `LimitExceeded` errors when trying to allocate new Dedicated Hosts\. If this is the case, try allocating new hosts again after a few minutes\.

The instances that were stopped are still available for use and are listed on the **Instances** page\. They retain their `host` tenancy setting\.

## Purchasing Dedicated Host Reservations<a name="purchasing-dedicated-host-reservations"></a>
