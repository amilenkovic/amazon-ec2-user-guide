# Launching an Instance Using the Launch Instance Wizard<a name="launching-instance"></a>

Before you launch your instance, be sure that you are set up\. For more information, see [Setting Up with Amazon EC2](get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.md)\.

Your AWS account might support both the EC2\-Classic and EC2\-VPC platforms, depending on when you created your account and which regions you've used\. To find out which platform your account supports, see [Supported Platforms](ec2-supported-platforms.md)\. If your account supports EC2\-Classic, you can launch an instance into either platform\. If your account supports EC2\-VPC only, you can launch an instance into a VPC only\. 

**Important**  
When you launch an instance that's not within the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), you are charged for the time that the instance is running, even if it remains idle\.

## Launching Your Instance from an AMI<a name="launch-instance-console"></a>

When you launch an instance, you must select a configuration, known as an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)\. An AMI contains the information required to create a new instance\. For example, an AMI might contain the software required to act as a web server: for example, Linux, Apache, and your website\.

**Tip**  
To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches\. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances\.

**To launch an instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, the current region is displayed\. Select the region for the instance\. This choice is important because some Amazon EC2 resources can be shared between regions, while others can't\. Select the region that meets your needs\. For more information, see [Resource Locations](resources.md)\.  
![\[Launch instance start\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/EC2_select_region.png)

1. From the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, choose **Launch Instance**\.

1. On the **Choose an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)** page, choose an AMI as follows:

   1. Select the type of AMI to use in the left pane:  
**Quick Start**  
A selection of popular AMIs to help you get started quickly\. To select an AMI that is eligible for the free tier, choose **Free tier only** in the left pane\. These AMIs are marked **Free tier eligible**\.  
**My AMIs**  
The private AMIs that you own, or private AMIs that have been shared with you\. To view AMIs shared with you, choose **Shared with me** in the left pane\.  
**AWS Marketplace**  
An online store where you can buy software that runs on AWS, including AMIs\. For more information about launching an instance from the AWS Marketplace, see [Launching an AWS Marketplace Instance](launch-marketplace-console.md)\.  
**Community AMIs**  
The AMIs that AWS community members have made available for others to use\. To filter the list of AMIs by operating system, choose the appropriate check box under **Operating system**\. You can also filter by architecture and root device type\.

   1. Check the **Root device type** listed for each AMI\. Notice which AMIs are the type that you need, either `ebs` \(backed by Amazon EBS\) or `instance-store` \(backed by instance store\)\. For more information, see [Storage for the Root Device](ComponentsAMIs.md#storage-for-the-root-device)\. 

   1. Check the **Virtualization type** listed for each AMI\. Notice which AMIs are the type that you need, either `hvm` or `paravirtual`\. For example, some instance types require HVM\. For more information, see [Linux AMI Virtualization Types](virtualization_types.md)\.

   1. Choose an AMI that meets your needs, and then choose **Select**\.

1. <a name="choose-an-instance-type-page"></a>On the **Choose an Instance Type** page, select the hardware configuration and size of the instance to launch\. Larger instance types have more CPU and memory\. For more information, see [Instance Types](instance-types.md)\.

   To remain eligible for the free tier, choose the **t2\.micro** instance type\. For more information, see [T2 Instances](t2-instances.md)\.

   By default, the wizard displays current generation instance types, and selects the first available instance type based on the AMI that you selected\. To view previous generation instance types, choose **All generations** from the filter list\.
**Note**  
To set up an instance quickly for testing purposes, choose **Review and Launch** to accept the default configuration settings, and launch your instance\. Otherwise, to configure your instance further, choose **Next: Configure Instance Details**\.

1. <a name="configure_instance_details_step"></a>On the **Configure Instance Details** page, change the following settings as necessary \(expand **Advanced Details** to see all the settings\), and then choose **Next: Add Storage**:
   + **Number of instances**: Enter the number of instances to launch\.
**Note**  
To help ensure that you maintain the correct number of instances to handle your application, you can choose **Launch into Auto Scaling Group** to create a launch configuration and an Auto Scaling group\. Auto Scaling scales the number of instances in the group according to your specifications\. For more information, see the [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/)\. 
   + **Purchasing option**: Select **Request Spot instances** to launch a Spot Instance\. This adds and removes options from this page\. Set your bid price, and optionally update the request type, interruption behavior, and request validity\. For more information, see [Creating a Spot Instance Request](spot-requests.md#using-spot-instances-request)\.
   + Your account may support the EC2\-Classic and EC2\-VPC platforms, or EC2\-VPC only\. To find out which platform your account supports, see [Supported Platforms](ec2-supported-platforms.md)\. If your account supports EC2\-VPC only, you can launch your instance into your default VPC or a nondefault VPC\. Otherwise, you can launch your instance into EC2\-Classic or a nondefault VPC\.
**Note**  
Some instance types must be launched into a VPC\. If you don't have a VPC, you can let the wizard create one for you\.

     To launch into EC2\-Classic:
     + **Network**: Select **Launch into EC2\-Classic**\.
     + **Availability Zone**: Select the Availability Zone to use\. To let AWS choose an Availability Zone for you, select **No preference**\.

     To launch into a VPC:
     + **Network**: Select the VPC, or to create a new VPC, choose **Create new VPC** to go the Amazon VPC console\. When you have finished, return to the wizard and choose **Refresh** to load your VPC in the list\.
     + **Subnet**: Select the subnet into which to launch your instance\. If your account is EC2\-VPC only, select **No preference** to let AWS choose a default subnet in any Availability Zone\. To create a new subnet, choose **Create new subnet** to go to the Amazon VPC console\. When you are done, return to the wizard and choose **Refresh** to load your subnet in the list\. 
     + **Auto\-assign Public IP**: Specify whether your instance receives a public IPv4 address\. By default, instances in a default subnet receive a public IPv4 address and instances in a nondefault subnet do not\. You can select **Enable** or **Disable** to override the subnet's default setting\. For more information, see [Public IPv4 Addresses and External DNS Hostnames](using-instance-addressing.md#concepts-public-addresses)\.
     + **Auto\-assign IPv6 IP**: Specify whether your instance receives an IPv6 address from the range of the subnet\. Select **Enable** or **Disable** to override the subnet's default setting\. This option is only available if you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnet\. For more information, see [Your VPC and Subnets](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.
   + **IAM role**: Select an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role to associate with the instance\. For more information, see [IAM Roles for Amazon EC2](iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md)\.
   + **Shutdown behavior**: Select whether the instance should stop or terminate when shut down\. For more information, see [Changing the Instance Initiated Shutdown Behavior](terminating-instances.md#Using_ChangingInstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior)\.
   + **Enable termination protection**: To prevent accidental termination, select this check box\. For more information, see [Enabling Termination Protection for an Instance](terminating-instances.md#Using_ChangingDisableAPITermination)\.
   + **Monitoring**: Select this check box to enable detailed monitoring of your instance using Amazon CloudWatch\. Additional charges apply\. For more information, see [Monitoring Your Instances Using CloudWatch](using-cloudwatch.md)\.
   + **EBS\-Optimized instance**: An Amazon EBS\-optimized instance uses an optimized configuration stack and provides additional, dedicated capacity for Amazon EBS I/O\. If the instance type supports this feature, select this check box to enable it\. Additional charges apply\. For more information, see [Amazon EBSâ€“Optimized Instances](EBSOptimized.md)\.
   + **Tenancy**: If you are launching your instance into a VPC, you can choose to run your instance on isolated, dedicated hardware \(**Dedicated**\) or on a Dedicated Host \(**Dedicated host**\)\. Additional charges may apply\. For more information, see [Dedicated Instances](dedicated-instance.md) and [Dedicated Hosts](dedicated-hosts-overview.md)\.
   + **T2 Unlimited**: \(Only valid for T2 instances\) Select this check box to enable applications to burst beyond the baseline for as long as needed\. Additional charges may apply\. For more information, see [T2 Instances](t2-instances.md)\.
   + **Network interfaces**: If you selected a specific subnet, you can specify up to two network interfaces for your instance:
     + For **Network Interface**, select **New network interface** to let AWS create a new interface, or select an existing, available network interface\.
     + For **Primary IP**, enter a private IPv4 address from the range of your subnet, or leave **Auto\-assign** to let AWS choose a private IPv4 address for you\.
     + For **Secondary IP addresses**, choose **Add IP** to assign more than one private IPv4 address to the selected network interface\.
     + \(IPv6\-only\) For **IPv6 IPs**, choose **Add IP**, and enter an IPv6 address from the range of the subnet, or leave **Auto\-assign** to let AWS choose one for you\.
     + Choose **Add Device** to add a secondary network interface\. A secondary network interface can reside in a different subnet of the VPC, provided it's in the same Availability Zone as your instance\.

     For more information, see [Elastic Network Interfaces](using-eni.md)\. If you specify more than one network interface, your instance cannot receive a public IPv4 address\. Additionally, if you specify an existing network interface for eth0, you cannot override the subnet's public IPv4 setting using **Auto\-assign Public IP**\. For more information, see [Assigning a Public IPv4 Address During Instance Launch](using-instance-addressing.md#public-ip-addresses)\.
   + **Kernel ID**: \(Only valid for paravirtual \(PV\) AMIs\) Select **Use default** unless you want to use a specific kernel\.
   + **RAM disk ID**: \(Only valid for paravirtual \(PV\) AMIs\) Select **Use default** unless you want to use a specific RAM disk\. If you have selected a kernel, you may need to select a specific RAM disk with the drivers to support it\.
   + **Placement group**: A placement group determines the placement strategy of your instances\. Select an existing placement group, or create a new one\. This option is only available if you've selected an instance type that supports placement groups\. For more information, see [Placement Groups](placement-groups.md)\.
   + **User data**: You can specify user data to configure an instance during launch, or to run a configuration script\. To attach a file, select the **As file** option and browse for the file to attach\.

1. The AMI you selected includes one or more volumes of storage, including the root device volume\. On the **Add Storage** page, you can specify additional volumes to attach to the instance by choosing **Add New Volume**\. You can configure the following options for each volume:
   + **Type**: Select instance store or Amazon EBS volumes to associate with your instance\. The type of volume available in the list depends on the instance type you've chosen\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Store](InstanceStorage.md) and [Amazon EBS Volumes](EBSVolumes.md)\.
   + **Device**: Select from the list of available device names for the volume\. 
   + **Snapshot**: Enter the name or ID of the snapshot from which to restore a volume\. You can also search for public snapshots by typing text into the **Snapshot** field\. Snapshot descriptions are case\-sensitive\.
   + **Size**: For Amazon EBS\-backed volumes, you can specify a storage size\. Even if you have selected an AMI and instance that are eligible for the free tier, to stay within the free tier, you must keep under 30 GiB of total storage\.
**Note**  
Linux AMIs require GPT partition tables and GRUB 2 for boot volumes 2 TiB \(2048 GiB\) or larger\. Many Linux AMIs today use the MBR partitioning scheme, which only supports up to 2047 GiB boot volumes\. If your instance does not boot with a boot volume that is 2 TiB or larger, the AMI you are using may be limited to a 2047 GiB boot volume size\. Non\-boot volumes do not have this limitation on Linux instances\.
**Note**  
If you increase the size of your root volume at this point \(or any other volume created from a snapshot\), you need to extend the file system on that volume in order to use the extra space\. For more information about extending your file system after your instance has launched, see [Modifying the Size, IOPS, or Type of an EBS Volume on Linux](ebs-modify-volume.md)\.
   + **Volume Type**: For Amazon EBS volumes, select either a General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, or Magnetic volume\. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Volume Types](EBSVolumeTypes.md)\.
**Note**  
If you select a Magnetic boot volume, you'll be prompted when you complete the wizard to make General Purpose SSD volumes the default boot volume for this instance and future console launches\. \(This preference persists in the browser session, and does not affect AMIs with Provisioned IOPS SSD boot volumes\.\) We recommended that you make General Purpose SSD volumes the default because they provide a much faster boot experience and they are the optimal volume type for most workloads\. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Volume Types](EBSVolumeTypes.md)\.
**Note**  
Some AWS accounts created before 2012 might have access to Availability Zones in us\-west\-1 or ap\-northeast\-1 that do not support Provisioned IOPS SSD \(`io1`\) volumes\. If you are unable to create an `io1` volume \(or launch an instance with an `io1` volume in its block device mapping\) in one of these regions, try a different Availability Zone in the region\. You can verify that an Availability Zone supports `io1` volumes by creating a 4 GiB `io1` volume in that zone\.
   + **IOPS**: If you have selected a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume type, then you can enter the number of I/O operations per second \(IOPS\) that the volume can support\.
   + **Delete on Termination**: For Amazon EBS volumes, select this check box to delete the volume when the instance is terminated\. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS Volumes on Instance Termination](terminating-instances.md#preserving-volumes-on-termination)\.
   + **Encrypted**: Select a value in this menu to configure the encryption state of new Amazon EBS volumes\. The default value is **Not encrypted**\. Additional options include using your AWS managed customer master key \(CMK\) or a customer\-managed CMK that you have created\. Available keys are listed in the menu\. You can also hover over the field and paste the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of a key directly into the text box\. For information about creating customer\-managed CMKs, see [AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/EBSEncryption.html)\. 
**Note**  
Encrypted volumes may only be attached to [supported instance types](EBSEncryption.md#EBSEncryption_supported_instances)\.

   When done configuring your volumes, choose **Next: Add Tags**\.

1. On the **Add Tags** page, specify [tags](Using_Tags.md) by providing key and value combinations\. You can tag the instance, the volumes, or both\. For Spot Instances, you can tag the Spot Instance request only\. Choose **Add another tag** to add more than one tag to your resources\. Choose **Next: Configure Security Group** when you are done\. 

1. On the **Configure Security Group** page, use a security group to define firewall rules for your instance\. These rules specify which incoming network traffic is delivered to your instance\. All other traffic is ignored\. \(For more information about security groups, see [Amazon EC2 Security Groups for Linux Instances](using-network-security.md)\.\) Select or create a security group as follows, and then choose **Review and Launch**\.

   1. To select an existing security group, choose **Select an existing security group**, and select your security group\. If you are launching into EC2\-Classic, the security groups are for EC2\-Classic\. If you are launching into a VPC, the security groups are for that VPC\.
**Note**  
\(Optional\) You can't edit the rules of an existing security group, but you can copy them to a new group by choosing **Copy to new**\. Then you can add rules as described in the next step\.

   1. To create a new security group, choose **Create a new security group**\. The wizard automatically defines the launch\-wizard\-*x* security group and creates an inbound rule to allow you to connect to your instance over SSH \(port 22\)\.

   1. You can add rules to suit your needs\. For example, if your instance is a web server, open ports 80 \(HTTP\) and 443 \(HTTPS\) to allow internet traffic\.

      To add a rule, choose **Add Rule**, select the protocol to open to network traffic, and then specify the source\. Choose **My IP** from the **Source** list to let the wizard add your computer's public IP address\. However, if you are connecting through an ISP or from behind your firewall without a static IP address, you need to find out the range of IP addresses used by client computers\.
**Warning**  
Rules that enable all IP addresses \(`0.0.0.0/0`\) to access your instance over SSH or RDP are acceptable for this short exercise, but are unsafe for production environments\. You should authorize only a specific IP address or range of addresses to access your instance\.

1. On the **Review Instance Launch** page, check the details of your instance, and make any necessary changes by choosing the appropriate **Edit** link\. 

   When you are ready, choose **Launch**\.

1. In the **Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair** dialog box, you can choose an existing key pair, or create a new one\. For example, choose **Choose an existing key pair**, then select the key pair you created when getting set up\.

   To launch your instance, select the acknowledgment check box, then choose **Launch Instances**\.
**Important**  
If you choose the **Proceed without key pair** option, you won't be able to connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in\.

1. \(Optional\) You can create a status check alarm for the instance \(additional fees may apply\)\. \(If you're not sure, you can always add one later\.\) On the confirmation screen, choose **Create status check alarms** and follow the directions\. For more information, see [Creating and Editing Status Check Alarms](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md#creating_status_check_alarms)\.

1. If the instance state immediately goes to `terminated` instead of `running`, you can get information about why the instance didn't launch\. For more information, see [What to Do If an Instance Immediately Terminates](Using_InstanceStraightToTerminated.md)\.
