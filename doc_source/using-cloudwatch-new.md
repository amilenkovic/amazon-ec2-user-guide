# Enable or Disable Detailed Monitoring for Your Instances<a name="using-cloudwatch-new"></a>

By default, your instance is enabled for basic monitoring\. You can optionally enable detailed monitoring\. After you enable detailed monitoring, the Amazon EC2 console displays monitoring graphs with a 1\-minute period for the instance\. The following table describes basic and detailed monitoring for instances\.


| Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Basic  |  Data is available automatically in 5\-minute periods at no charge\.  | 
|  Detailed  |  Data is available in 1\-minute periods for an additional cost\. To get this level of data, you must specifically enable it for the instance\. For the instances where you've enabled detailed monitoring, you can also get aggregated data across groups of similar instances\. For information about pricing, see the [Amazon CloudWatch product page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch)\.  |
