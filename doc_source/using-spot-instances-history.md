# Spot Instance Pricing History<a name="using-spot-instances-history"></a>

When you request Spot Instances, we recommend that you use the default maximum price \(the On\-Demand price\)\. If you want to specify a maximum price, we recommend that you review the Spot price history before you do so\. You can view the Spot price history for the last 90 days, filtering by instance type, operating system, and Availability Zone\.

**To view the Spot price history using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Spot Requests**\.

1. If you are new to Spot Instances, you see a welcome page\. Choose **Get started**, scroll to the bottom of the screen, and then choose **Cancel**\.

1. Choose **Pricing History**\. By default, the page displays a graph of the data for Linux `t1.micro` instances in all Availability Zones over the past day\. Move your pointer over the graph to display the prices at specific times in the table below the graph\.
