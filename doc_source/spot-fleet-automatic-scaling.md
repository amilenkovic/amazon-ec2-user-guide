# Automatic Scaling for Spot Fleet<a name="spot-fleet-automatic-scaling"></a>

*Automatic scaling* is the ability to increase or decrease the target capacity of your Spot Fleet automatically based on demand\. A Spot Fleet can either launch instances \(scale out\) or terminate instances \(scale in\), within the range that you choose, in response to one or more scaling policies\.

If you are using instance weighting, keep in mind that Spot Fleet can exceed the target capacity as needed, and that fulfilled capacity can be a floating\-point number but target capacity must be an integer, so Spot Fleet rounds up to the next integer\. You must take these behaviors into account when you look at the outcome of a scaling policy when an alarm is triggered\. For example, suppose that the target capacity is 30, the fulfilled capacity is 30\.1, and the scaling policy subtracts 1\. When the alarm is triggered, the auto scaling process subtracts 1 from 30\.1 to get 29\.1 and then rounds it up to 30, so no scaling action is taken\. As another example, suppose that you selected instance weights of 2, 4, and 8, and a target capacity of 10, but no weight 2 instances were available so Spot Fleet provisioned instances of weights 4 and 8 for a fulfilled capacity of 12\. If the scaling policy decreases target capacity by 20% and an alarm is triggered, the auto scaling process subtracts 12\*0\.2 from 12 to get 9\.6 and then rounds it up to 10, so no scaling action is taken\.

You can also configure the cooldown period for a scaling policy\. This is the number of seconds after a scaling activity completes where previous trigger\-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events\. For scale out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been added by the previous scale out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale out\. The intention is to continuously \(but not excessively\) scale out\. For scale in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale in requests until it has expired\. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability\. However, if another alarm triggers a scale out policy during the cooldown period after a scale\-in, auto scaling scales out your scalable target immediately\.

Spot Fleet supports the following types of scaling policies:
+ [Target tracking scaling](spot-fleet-target-tracking.md)—Increase or decrease  the current capacity of the fleet based on a target value for a specific metric\. This is similar to the way that your thermostat maintains the temperature of your home – you select temperature and the thermostat does the rest\.
+ [Step scaling](spot-fleet-step-scaling.md)—Increase or decrease the current capacity of the fleet based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, that vary based on the size of the alarm breach\.
