## Additional CloudWatch Metrics for T2 Instances<a name="t2-cw-metrics"></a>

T2 instances have four additional CloudWatch metrics, which are updated every five minutes:
+ `CPUCreditUsage` – The number of CPU credits spent during the measurement period\.
+ `CPUCreditBalance` – The number of CPU credits that a T2 instance has accrued\. This balance is depleted when the CPU bursts and CPU credits are spent more quickly than they are earned\.
+ `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` – The number of surplus CPU credits spent to sustain CPU performance when the `CPUCreditBalance` is zero\.
+ `CPUSurplusCreditsCharged` – The number of surplus CPU credits that exceed the [maximum number of CPU credits](t2-credits-baseline-concepts.md#t2-credit-table) that can be earned in a 24\-hour period, and thus attract an additional charge\.

The last two metrics apply only to T2 instances configured as `unlimited`\. 

The following table describes the CloudWatch metrics for T2 instances\. For more information about using these metrics in CloudWatch, see [List the Available CloudWatch Metrics for Your Instances](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md)\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| CPUCreditUsage |  \[T2 instances\] The number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU utilization\. One CPU credit equals one vCPU running at 100% utilization for one minute or an equivalent combination of vCPUs, utilization, and time \(for example, one vCPU running at 50% utilization for two minutes or two vCPUs running at 25% utilization for two minutes\)\. CPU credit metrics are available at a five\-minute frequency only\. If you specify a period greater than five minutes, use the `Sum` statistic instead of the `Average` statistic\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| CPUCreditBalance |  \[T2 instances\] The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started\. For T2 Standard, the `CPUCreditBalance` also includes the number of launch credits that have been accrued\. Credits are accrued in the credit balance after they are earned, and removed from the credit balance when they are spent\. The credit balance has a maximum limit, determined by the instance size\. Once the limit is reached, any new credits that are earned are discarded\. For T2 Standard, launch credits do not count towards the limit\. The credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` are available for the instance to spend to burst beyond its baseline CPU utilization\. When an instance is running, credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` do not expire\. When the instance stops, the `CPUCreditBalance` does not persist, and all accrued credits are lost\. CPU credit metrics are available at a five\-minute frequency only\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| CPUSurplusCreditBalance  |  \[T2 Unlimited instances\] The number of surplus credits that have been spent by a T2 Unlimited instance when its `CPUCreditBalance` is zero\. The `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` is paid down by earned CPU credits\. If the number of surplus credits exceeds the maximum number of credits the instance can earn in a 24\-hour period, the spent surplus credits above the maximum incur an additional charge\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)   | 
| CPUSurplusCreditsCharged |  \[T2 Unlimited instances\] The number of spent surplus credits that are not paid down by earned CPU credits, and thus incur an additional charge\. Spent surplus credits are charged when any of the following occurs:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-instances-monitoring-cpu-credits.html) Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)   | 

## Calculating CPU Credit Usage<a name="t2-calculating-credit-use"></a>

The CPU credit usage of T2 Standard and T2 Unlimited instances is calculated using the T2 instance CloudWatch metrics described in the preceding table\. 

Amazon EC2 sends the metrics to CloudWatch every five minutes\. A reference to a *prior* value of a metric at any point in time implies the previous value of the metric, sent *five minutes ago*\.

### Calculating CPU Credit Usage for T2 Standard<a name="t2-std-calculation"></a>
+ The CPU credit balance increases if CPU utilization is below the baseline, when credits spent are less than credits earned in the prior five\-minute interval\. 
+ The CPU credit balance decreases if CPU utilization is above the baseline, when credits spent are more than credits earned in the prior five\-minute interval\. 

Mathematically, this is captured by the following equation:

**Example**  

```
CPUCreditBalance = prior CPUCreditBalance + [Credits earned per hour * (5/60) - CPUCreditUsage]
```

The size of the instance determines the number of credits that the instance can earn per hour and the number of earned credits it can accrue in the credit balance\. For information about the number of credits earned per hour, and the credit balance limit for each T2 instance size, see [the T2 credit table](t2-credits-baseline-concepts.md#t2-credit-table)\.

**Example**  
This example uses a `t2.micro` instance\. To calculate the `CPUCreditBalance` of the instance, use the preceding equation as follows:
+ `CPUCreditBalance` – The current credit balance to calculate\.
+ `prior CPUCreditBalance` – The credit balance five minutes ago\. In this example, the instance had accrued two credits\.
+ `Credits earned per hour` – A `t2.micro` instance earns six credits per hour\.
+ `5/60` – Represents the five\-minute interval between CloudWatch metric publication\. Multiply the credits earned per hour by 5/60 \(five minutes\) to get the number of credits the instance earned in the past five minutes\. A `t2.micro` instance earns 0\.5 credits every five minutes\.
+ `CPUCreditUsage` – How many credits the instance spent in the past five minutes\. In this example, the instance spent one credit in the past five minutes\.

Using these values, you can calculate the `CPUCreditBalance` value:

**Example**  

```
CPUCreditBalance = 2 + [0.5 - 1] = 1.5
```

### Calculating CPU Credit Usage for T2 Unlimited<a name="t2-unlimited-calculation"></a>

When a T2 instance needs to burst above the baseline, it always spends it accrued credits before spending surplus credits\. When it depletes its accrued CPU credit balance, it can spend surplus credits to burst for as long as it needs\. When CPU utilization falls below the baseline, surplus credits are always paid down before the instance accrues earned credits\.

We use the term `Adjusted balance` in the following equations to reflect the activity that occurs in this five\-minute interval\. We use this value to arrive at the values for the `CPUCreditBalance` and `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` CloudWatch metrics\. 

**Example**  

```
Adjusted balance = [prior CPUCreditBalance - prior CPUSurplusCreditBalance] + [Credits earned per hour * (5/60) - CPUCreditUsage]
```

A value of `0` for `Adjusted balance` indicates that the instance spent all its earned credits for bursting, and no surplus credits were spent\. As a result, both `CPUCreditBalance` and `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` are set to `0`\.

A positive `Adjusted balance` value indicates that the instance accrued earned credits, and previous surplus credits, if any, were paid down\. As a result, the `Adjusted balance` value is assigned to `CPUCreditBalance`, and the `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` is set to `0`\. The instance size determines the [maximum number of credits](t2-credits-baseline-concepts.md#t2-credit-table) it can accrue\.

**Example**  

```
CPUCreditBalance = min [max earned credit balance, Adjusted balance]
CPUSurplusCreditBalance = 0
```

A negative `Adjusted balance` value indicates that the instance spent all its earned credits that it accrued and, in addition, also spent surplus credits for bursting\. As a result, the `Adjusted balance` value is assigned to `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` and the `CPUCreditBalance` is set to `0`\. Again, the instance size determines the [maximum number of credits](t2-credits-baseline-concepts.md#t2-credit-table) it can accrue\.

**Example**  

```
CPUSurplusCreditBalance = min [max earned credit balance, -Adjusted balance]
CPUCreditBalance = 0
```

If the surplus credits spent exceed the maximum credits the instance can accrue, the surplus credit balance is set to the maximum as shown in the preceding equation\. The remaining surplus credits are charged as represented by the `CPUSurplusCreditsCharged` metric\.

**Example**  

```
CPUSurplusCreditsCharged = max [-Adjusted balance - max earned credit balance, 0]
```

Finally, when the instance terminates, any surplus credits tracked by the `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` are charged\. If the instance is switched from Unlimited to Standard, any remaining `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` is also charged\.
