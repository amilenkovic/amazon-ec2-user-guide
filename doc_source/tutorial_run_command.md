# Tutorial: Remotely Manage Your Amazon EC2 Instances<a name="tutorial_run_command"></a>

This tutorial shows you how to remotely manage an Amazon EC2 instance using Systems Manager Run Command from your local machine\. This tutorial includes procedures for executing commands using the Amazon EC2 console, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, and the AWS Command Line Interface\.

**Note**  
With Run Command, you can also manage your servers and virtual machines \(VMs\) in your on\-premises environment or in an environment provided by other cloud providers\. For more information, see [Setting Up Systems Manager in Hybrid Environments](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html)\.

**Before you Begin**  
You must configure an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) instance profile role for Systems Manager\. Attach an IAM role with the **AmazonEC2RoleforSSM** managed policy to an Amazon EC2 instance\. This role enables the instance to communicate with the Systems Manager API\. For more information about how to attach the role to an existing instance, see [Attaching an IAM Role to an Instance](iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md#attach-iam-role)\.

You must also configure your IAM user account for Systems Manager, as described in the next section\.

## Grant Your User Account Access to Systems Manager<a name="tutorial-iam-rc"></a>

Your user account must be configured to communicate with the SSM API\. Use the following procedure to attach a managed AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policy to your user account that grants you full access to SSM API actions\.

**To create the IAM policy for your user account**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**\. \(If this is your first time using IAM, choose **Get Started**, and then choose **Create Policy**\.\)

1. In the **Filter** field, type **AmazonSSMFullAccess** and press Enter\.

1. Select the check box next to **AmazonSSMFullAccess** and then choose **Policy Actions**, **Attach**\.

1. On the **Attach Policy** page, choose your user account and then choose **Attach Policy**\.

## Install the SSM Agent<a name="tutorial-agent-install"></a>

SSM Agent processes Run Command requests and configures the instances that are specified in the request\. The agent is installed by default on Windows AMIs starting in November 2016 and later and Amazon Linux AMIs starting with 2017\.09\.

To install the agent on Linux, see [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent on Linux Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-agent.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

To install the agent on Windows, see [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent on Windows Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-win.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

## Send a Command Using the EC2 Console<a name="rc-tutorial-ui"></a>

Use the following procedure to list all services running on the instance by using Run Command from the Amazon EC2 console\.

**To execute a command using Run Command from the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Run Command**\.

1. Choose **Run a command**\.

1. For **Command document**, choose **AWS\-RunPowerShellScript** for Windows instances, and **AWS\-RunShellScript** for Linux instances\.

1. For **Target instances**, choose the instance you created\. If you don't see the instance, verify that you are currently in the same region as the instance you created\. Also verify that you configured the IAM role and trust policies as described earlier\.

1. For **Commands**, type **Get\-Service** for Windows, or **ps aux** for Linux\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Working Directory**, specify a path to the folder on your EC2 instances where you want to run the command\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Execution Timeout**, specify the number of seconds the EC2Config service or SSM agent will attempt to run the command before it times out and fails\.

1. For **Comment**, we recommend providing information that will help you identify this command in your list of commands\.

1. For **Timeout \(seconds\)**, type the number of seconds that Run Command should attempt to reach an instance before it is considered unreachable and the command execution fails\.

1. Choose **Run** to execute the command\. Run Command displays a status screen\. Choose **View result**\.

1. To view the output, choose the command invocation for the command, choose the **Output** tab, and then choose **View Output**\.

## Send a Command Using AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell<a name="tutorial-powershell"></a>

Use the following procedure to list all services running on the instance by using Run Command from AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\.

**To execute a command**

1. On your local computer, download the latest version of [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/)\.

1. Open **AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell** on your local computer and execute the following command to specify your credentials\. 

   ```
   Set-AWSCredentials –AccessKey key –SecretKey key
   ```

1. Execute the following command to set the region for your PowerShell session\. Specify the region where you created the instance in the previous procedure\. This example uses the us\-west\-2 region\.

   ```
   Set-DefaultAWSRegion -Region us-west-2
   ```

1. Execute the following command to retrieve the services running on the instance\. 

   ```
   Send-SSMCommand -InstanceId 'Instance-ID' -DocumentName AWS-RunPowerShellScript -Comment 'listing services on the instance' -Parameter @{'commands'=@('Get-Service')}
   ```

   The command returns a command ID, which you will use to view the results\.

1. The following command returns the output of the original Send\-SSMCommand\. The output is truncated after 2500 characters\. To view the full list of services, specify an Amazon S3 bucket in the command using the \-OutputS3BucketName *bucket\_name* parameter\.

   ```
   Get-SSMCommandInvocation -CommandId Command-ID -Details $true | select -ExpandProperty CommandPlugins
   ```

For more examples of how to execute commands using Run Command with Tools for Windows PowerShell, see [Systems Manager Run Command Walkthough Using the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/walkthrough-powershell.html)\.

## Send a Command Using the AWS CLI<a name="tutorial-cli"></a>

Use the following procedure to list all services running on the instance by using Run Command in the AWS CLI\.

**To execute a command**

1. On your local computer, download the latest version of the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) \(AWS CLI\)\.

1. Open the AWS CLI on your local computer and execute the following command to specify your credentials and the region\.

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

1. The system prompts you to specify the following\.

   ```
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: key
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: key
   Default region name [None]: region, for example us-east-1
   Default output format [None]: ENTER
   ```

1. Execute the following command to retrieve the services running on the instance\. 

   ```
   aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" --comment "listing services" --instance-ids "Instance-ID" --parameters commands="service --status-all" --region us-west-2 --output text
   ```

   The command returns a command ID, which you will use to view the results\.

1. The following command returns the output of the original Send\-SSMCommand\. The output is truncated after 2500 characters\. To view the full list of services, you would need to specify an Amazon S3 bucket in the command using the \-\-output\-s3\-bucket\-name *bucket\_name* parameter\.

   ```
   aws ssm list-command-invocations --command-id "command ID" --details
   ```
